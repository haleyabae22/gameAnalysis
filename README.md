# gameAnalysis
AI/ML sport analysis program using YOLO, OpenCV, and Python (Plan to implement Pytorch or Tensorflow for foul analysis)

## Project Status
This is a research/prototype project demonstrating AI and computer vision techniques. 
Features include YOLO-based object detection, Optical Flow for motion analysis, and automated foul reporting. 
Work in progress; not a finalized product.
